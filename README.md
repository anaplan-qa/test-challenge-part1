Anaplan Test Challenge - Spotify API
=========================================

Before your technical interview, we'd like you to clone this repo and do some preparation work.

This is a skeleton Cucumber/Java test framework with which we'd like you to write tests.

You will be using the Spotify API for this testing challenge.


Pre-interview setup
---------------------
There are two things we'd like you do do in preparation for the technical interview:

1. There is some authorisation setup that takes some time and would be good to get done outside of the technical interview time. We'd like to see this in a step or a Before hook in your implementation of this test framework. We have provided Anaplan's Spotify account's Basic Auth credential string in the Candidate Pack you were emailed. You may use any HTTP library you wish for the API calls in this tech test. Please review this guide on how to authorise with Spotify and retrieve an authorisation token that you can use for subsequent calls:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide


2. After authorisation and authentication has been sorted, we'd like you to write one or two tests in this framework against one of Spotify's endpoints, the documentation for which can be found here:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#reference-index

We will talk through your code during the interview and may ask you to write some more tests.

Submission
---------------------
You can send us your code by either zipping it up and emailing it to our recruiters, or by uploading it to your own Git repo and sending us the link to clone that.
